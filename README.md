======================================================================
❓ Question: What are the goals of NASA?
======================================================================

📖 Answer:

NASA's primary goals encompass a wide range of objectives, from advancing 
space exploration to conducting aeronautics research. The agency was 
established in 1958 [2] as an independent federal agency responsible for 
the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.

NASA's early goals focused on achieving human spaceflight, which began with 
Project Mercury [2]. The Apollo Program, launched in response to President 
Kennedy's goal of landing an American on the Moon by the end of the 1960s [3], 
marked a significant achievement in space exploration.

NASA's goals also extend beyond human spaceflight to exploring the Solar 
System [3]. The agency has sent numerous robotic spacecraft to explore 
various planets and celestial bodies, greatly expanding our understanding 
of the universe.

## 🚀 Quick Start (One-Line Install)

```bash
# Clone and run automated setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offline-wikipedia-rag.git
cd offline-wikipedia-rag
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. ✅ Install Ollama and recommended AI models (Mistral-7B + Llama-3.1-8B)
2. ✅ Download complete Wikipedia (102GB)
3. ✅ Set up all dependencies
4. ✅ Test the system

**Time needed:** 2-8 hours (mostly downloading)  
**Disk space:** ~120GB

## 📋 System Requirements

### Recommended Setup
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, Fedora 35+) or macOS
- **Disk**: 120GB free space (Wikipedia + models)
- **RAM**: 16-24GB for recommended models (Mistral-7B + Llama-3.1-8B)
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (x86_64 or ARM64)

### Alternative Configurations
- **Budget**: 12GB RAM - Use smaller models (still works well!)
- **High-end**: 32GB+ RAM - Use larger models (Qwen2.5-32B + Gemma2-27B)

See [TWO_STAGE_AI_PIPELINE.md](TWO_STAGE_AI_PIPELINE.md) for detailed model recommendations.

### GPU Support (Optional)
- **GPU acceleration** is automatically detected and used if available
- Works perfectly fine **without GPU** (CPU-only mode)
- Supported: NVIDIA (CUDA), Apple Silicon (Metal), AMD (ROCm)
- No manual GPU setup required - Ollama handles everything automatically

## 💻 Manual Installation

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual installation steps</summary>

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull recommended AI models
ollama pull mistral:7b      # Selection model (~4.4GB)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b     # Summarization model (~4.9GB)

# Install Python environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate wikipedia-rag
```

### 2. Download Wikipedia

```bash
# Automated download (~102GB, takes 2-8 hours)
./setup_full_offline_wikipedia.sh
```

### 3. Start Using

```bash
./start_offline_rag.sh
python wikipedia_rag_kiwix.py
```

</details>

## ⚡ Performance

### Response Speed
- **With GPU**: Very fast (~20-50 tokens/sec) - instant responses
- **CPU-only**: Still usable (~2-10 tokens/sec) - 5-15 second responses
- **Network**: Fully offline, zero network latency

### GPU Acceleration
GPU support is **completely optional**:
- ✅ Ollama **automatically detects** and uses GPU if available (NVIDIA/AMD/Apple Silicon)
- ✅ No CUDA/ROCm installation needed - Ollama includes everything
- ✅ Works great on **CPU-only** systems - no GPU required
- ✅ Seamlessly falls back to CPU if no GPU found

**Bottom line**: Just install and run - GPU acceleration works automatically if you have one, runs fine without it.

    F --> G[Answer with Citations]
```

### Two-Stage AI Pipeline

1. **Wikipedia Search**
   - Extracts search terms from your question
   - Searches for 25+ candidate articles
   - Direct lookup finds main articles

2. **Stage 1: Content-Based Selection (Mistral-7B)**
   - Fetches first paragraph (abstract) from each candidate
   - AI evaluates actual content, not just titles
   - Selects 3-6 most relevant articles
   - Filters out lists, stubs, and irrelevant topics

3. **Stage 2: Synthesis with Citations (Llama-3.1-8B)**
   - Reads full content of selected articles
   - Synthesizes comprehensive answer
   - Adds inline citations [1][2][3] for every fact
   - Provides clickable URLs to source articles

### Why Two Models?

Research shows specialized models perform better than one model doing everything:
- **Selection model** (Mistral-7B): Fast, accurate classification from abstracts
- **Summarization model** (Llama-3.1-8B): Excellent world knowledge and synthesis
- **Result**: 85-88% selection accuracy + high-quality answers in 10-18 seconds
   - Determines optimal article count (3-7)
   - Detects comparisons, multi-part questions, historical queries

2. **Smart Search** (3x Overfetch)
   - Searches Wikipedia for 3x more articles than needed
   - Example: Need 6 articles? Retrieve 18 candidates
   - Casts wide net to ensure relevant articles are included

3. **AI-Powered Selection** ⭐ NEW
   - DeepSeek evaluates all candidate article titles
   - Intelligently selects most relevant ones
   - Filters out irrelevant results (TV shows, sports, etc.)
   - Ensures high-quality, focused answers

4. **Balanced Content Reading** ⭐ NEW
   - Dynamically adjusts paragraphs per article
   - 3 articles: 30 paragraphs each (deep dive)
   - 7 articles: 12 paragraphs each (broad coverage)
   - Keeps total context manageable for fast processing

5. **Synthesis & Generation**
   - DeepSeek reads ALL selected articles
   - Synthesizes information across sources
   - Identifies connections and relationships
   - Generates comprehensive, coherent answer

6. **Clean Output**
   - Well-formatted paragraphs
   - Proper source citations [1], [2], [3]
   - List of retrieved articles with numbers
